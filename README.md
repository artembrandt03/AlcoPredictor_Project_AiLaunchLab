# AlcoPredictor Project (Summer 2024 AI Cohort)
This project was developed during the 2024 summer cohort organized by AI LaunchLab in collaboration with Dawson AI. The program provided an immersive experience into the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, focusing on hands-on learning and practical applications.

## About the Project
The AlcoPredictor is a machine learning model designed to analyze student behavior and predict early signs of alcohol consumption. The project aimed to assist in early intervention efforts by leveraging data-driven insights. Key aspects of the project include:

- Dataset: Included anonymized student data with a minimum age of 15, allowing for ethical and accurate predictions.
- Tools and Frameworks: The model was developed using Python and popular AI libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The project also utilized Google Colab for collaborative development and Streamlit for deploying the model interface.
- Key Features:
Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers were evaluated for the prediction task.
Ethical considerations were prioritized throughout, ensuring the model adhered to privacy and fairness standards.

## How it works
Based on a series of questions, the model tries to predict how much a student will be addicted to alcohol between "likely" and "not likely".

## Learning Experience
The cohort featured workshops on diverse AI topics, including ethics in AI, fine-tuning models, transformers, and neural networks. The collaborative environment fostered teamwork, with students training and fine-tuning their own models. The program also emphasized practical skills, with tutorials on tools like DistilBERT, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and the Confusion Matrix.

The culmination of the program was a presentation of team projects, showcasing innovative solutions to real-world problems.
